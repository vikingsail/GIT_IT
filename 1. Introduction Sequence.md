## commits are snapshots

    git commit
## branch early, and branch often

    git branch [name_of_branch]
> a branch essentially says **"I want to include the work of this commit and all parent commits"**  
>
> it is attached to a commit node  
>
> active branch marked by asterisk (*)  
## moving to another branch

    git checkout <name>
> create new branch and immediately commit afterwards:

    git checkout <name>;git commit
> ***[super cool]*** or shorter:

    git checkout -b [yourbranchname]
## merging creates a special commit that has two unique parents.

    git merge [branch_to_merge_with]
> the above command will merge [branch_to_merge_with] into the active one.  
>
> note: **[branch_to_merge_with] will not be in-sync with the finalised branch!**  
>
> to fix it, then use

    git checkout [branch_to_merge_with];git merge [merged_branch]
## rebasing "copies" a set of commits and attach them to an existing branch

    git rebase [name_of_branch]
> note: the original commit still exists somewhere
