## a commit = a snapshot of changes
	git commit
>a commit creates a new snapshot node:

	git commit

## "branch early, and branch often"
    git branch <name_of_branch>
>branches are lightweight:
1. it includes the work of this commit and all parent commits
2. it's easier to distribute the work to different branches than maintaining a single branch
3. active branch marked by asterisk: *

	git branch issue

![[Pasted image 20230811210905.png]]

	git commit

![[Pasted image 20230811213045.png]]

> Note that `git branch` only creates the branch. It does not switch the active branch to it.
## switching to another branch
	git checkout <branch_name>

> to create a new branch and immediately commit afterwards:

	git checkout <branch_name>
	git commit

equals to

	git checkout -b <branch_name>

> GIT 2.23 introduced `git switch` which will eventually replace `git checkout`.
## merge
>creates a special commit that has two unique parents.

    git merge <target_branch>

![[Pasted image 20230811215018.png]]

	git merge bugFix

![[Pasted image 20230811215104.png]]

merges `<target_branch>` into the active one. 

> note: **`<target_branch>` will not be in-sync with the finalised branch!**
> to fix it, use

![[Pasted image 20230811215542.png]]

    git checkout <target_branch>
    git merge <merged_branch>

![[Pasted image 20230811215640.png]]

## rebase
>"copies" a set of commits and attach them to an existing branch

	git rebase <branch_to_attach_to>

![[Pasted image 20230811220235.png]]

	git rebase main

![[Pasted image 20230811220303.png]]

to move `main` to the active branch:

	git rebase bugFix

![[Pasted image 20230811220505.png]]

> note: the original commit still exists somewhere
