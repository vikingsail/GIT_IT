## HEAD: a symbolic name for the currently checked out commit (attach point)
> to move HEAD around the git tree, use  

    git checkout [branch_name] or [commit_name]
## hash and relative refs.
> to move HEAD one commit upwards  
    
    git checkout [branch_name]^
> to move HEAD *num* commits upwards
    
    git checkout [branch_name]~<num>
> HEAD can be used as a reference too!

    git checkout [commit_name];git checkout HEAD^
## force assigning a branch to a commit

    git branch -f [branch_name] HEAD~<num>
## reverse changes w/ removing history

    git reset [commit_name](~<num>)
> eg. remove the changes of C3, go back to C1 and remove history:

    git reset HEAD~2
## reverse changes w/o removing history

    git revert [commit_name](~<num>)
> eg. revert the changes of C3, go back to C1, but keep the history:

    git revert HEAD~2
