# Locally stacked commits
> scenario: branched out bug-fixes need to be brough back to the `main`-branch  
>
> goal: bring the finalised bug fixed to `main`  
>
> solutions:  

    git rebase -i [node]~<num>
or

    git cherry-pick [node1] [node2] ...
# Juggling Commits
> scenario: commits stacked up in a row. need to make modifications to an earlier commit. and bring that change and all the sequential changes to `main`.
>
> strategy:
>- re-order the commits so the one we want to change is on the top

    git rebase -i
> - make the slight modification

    git commit --amend
> - re-order the commits back to how they were previously
    
    git rebase -i
> - move main to this updated part of the tree

    git branch -f [branch] [node]
# Juggling Commits #2
> The issue with the previous example is that there is a lot of reordering going on, which can introduce rebase conflicts. Let's look at another method with `git cherry-pick`.  
>
> note: remember that git cherry-pick will plop down a commit from *anywhere* in the tree onto HEAD ***(as long as that commit isn't an ancestor of HEAD)***.  
>
> strategy: use `git cherry-pick`to copy specific nodes to the current HEAD postion.

    git cherry-pick [node_to_change]
    git commit --amend
    git cherry-pick [other_nodes]
# Git Tags
> note: branches are easily mutated, often temporary, and always changing.
>
> therefore: **tags** can be used to *permanently* mark historical points (major releases, big merges, "milestones", etc) in your project's history.

    git tag <tag_name> [node_name]
> `[node_name]` is optional. without it, `HEAD` will be used as ref.
# Git Describe
> to describe where you are relative to the closest "anchor" (aka tag).

    git describe <ref>
> where `<ref>` is anything git can resolve into a commit. `HEAD` will be used without a specified `<ref>`.  
>
> The output of the command looks like:

    <tag>_<numCommits>_g<hash>
>- `<tag>` is the closest ancestor tag in history (tree)
>- `<numCommits>` is how many commits away that tag is
>- `<hash>` is the hash of the commit being described
>
> in other words: `<tag>x` is `<numCommits>` steps away from node `<hash>`.
